        <h3>Mushroom picking is something that I did with my family in childhood as this is common in my culture. It was fun finding them in the woods, like an easter egg hunt. I helped my mother prepare them too, learning about how different mushrooms are more suitable for some cooking methods but not for others. As an adult I have come to the decision that I would rather photograph and learn about how they survive, grow and contribute to the surrounging environment. I find this is more rewarding as it not destructive and a lot less work. Mushrooms are so much more beautiful when they are left to be.
